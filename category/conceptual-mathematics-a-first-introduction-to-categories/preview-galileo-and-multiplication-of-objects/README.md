# Session 1: Galileo and multiplication of objects

## Introduction

  * Goal of this book: explore the consequences of a new and fundamental insight about the nature of mathematics which has led to better methods for understanding and using mathematical concepts.
  * **Category**: a mathematical universe, corresponding to a particular subject matter.
    * There are ways to pass from one category to another 
    * Ingredients: objects, maps, compositions of maps
  * This chapter provides an informal introduction with some examples
  * Origin: **A workings of mathematics and the relationships of its parts**, 1945, by Eilenberg and Mac Lane
    * The categories involved in mathematics and their relationships have been implicit for centuries until 1945
    * This paper gave explicit definitions of the basic notions of category

## Galileo and the flight of a bird

  * Galileo wished to understand the precise motion of a thrown object
  * Everyone has observed the graceful parabolic arcs
  * Beyond the moving track, the motion involves the changing position for each instant
    * motion: `map/function` from `time` to `space`
